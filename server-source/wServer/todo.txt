X...fixed

* events 
* dungeons 
* item enhancement system
* vault customisation
* vault upgrades
* item reforge system (rings/armor too)
* better pet system
* PDG implementation (was on the source already, not really sure what this is..)
* Backpacks (3/4 done)
 - A backpack item to xml data files. (the object description of the backpack consumable that gives a user the backpack).
 - Make sure the client supports backpacks (the extra inventory space, tab selection, etc..).
 - In the server, handle the UseItemPacket properly. The stuff you'll need to edit is found in the Player.UseItem.cs file (at least for most sources it is).
 - Make sure player inventories can handle 20 slots.
 - Make flag for backpack in Player class to indicate if the player has a backpack or not.
 - Create a entry for backpacks on character database info.
 - make sure to save that the user has a backpack after one uses.
* toggable chat
X (dynamic) wheater system
* Achievements
X The Stat Problem (http://prnt.sc/b8sbr9)
 - if you take a look at the commits you'll find one called something like "StatExport", it didn't work that well because it reset things like slots, sized, portals, ...
   however, I'm pretty sure that the basic system worked since ossi claimed that he wrote it
* Grim Reaper is Donor only for some stupid reason
X Auto restart message 
* If item does not exist simply delete it in player inv / vault 
* Complete Guild rework
 - Fix Guild Hall
 - add more Guild activites
* New Cloths
* Redo leveling system
 - basically leveling up is pretty bugged since you don't start at 0 xp @level > 20
* Night-Day circulation (could rip it from fabs source)
 - It changes the client depending on what your time is
 - so lets say it’s 8 pm and you client starts to get “darker” or in some kind of “night mode” so it’s easier to read and doesn’t hurt your eyes
 - Same for day mode where it’s all bright n stuff

X better snow / rain effects (client side)
* Ignore list..?
* Racing Dung 
 - A dungeon where you race against your friends
 - maybe a test chest with 1 hp at the end so the first attacker will get the lewtz?
* Redo the music to be more fitting
* make /sc muteable
X Fix the /sc kick
X Fix the renaming of items to chars the server can't regocnize

Phoph's list
------------
uhh lemme list out all the things that can be improved in state management of the server

1.) delta compression (this is not sending the stattypes if they are mirrored on the client ack)
2.) probably better set management (lists are pretty standard but if you're really aching for speed im sure you can do something with arrays)
3.) export less stats
4.) lower tps where it's plausible (too low makes simulation shit itself)
5.) update throttling in castle, WC, nexus, and other high-volume player locations
6.) bitfielding the stats that ARE exported (pretty implausible in TCP)
7.) not using TCP because it's garbage for this

  <!--    
    Note that the client should support 2 byte tile id, but the protocol doesn't support
    Due to the same reason, some kind of object can only be within signed part because
    the client read them as signed short then cast to int, making them becomes negative
    number:
      Character: UpdatePacket -> Signed
           Item: ObjectStats  -> Full    BUT if it creates projectile (e.g. spell, quiver) THEN ShootPacket -> Signed
    Environment: UpdatePacket -> Signed
     Projectile: Client side  -> Full
        Textile: ObjectStats  -> Full
    Auto assign feature takes care of the limitations.
    
    Also to use remote texture, the client should have Parameters._-IO call patch to
    true in assembleegameclient.objects._-ZH and the texture should stored in 32 bits
    png format.
    
    And remember add 'ext' attributes
